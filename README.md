A [GraphQL multipart request spec](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec) implementation for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) App Router with [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server). Enables file uploads via GraphQL mutations using the `Upload` scalar, with built-in MIME type verification via magic bytes.

## Features

- Implements the [GraphQL multipart request spec](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec).
- Designed for Next.js App Router route handlers.
- Supports single file uploads, multiple file uploads, and operation batching.
- File deduplication (one file mapped to multiple operation paths).
- MIME type verified via magic bytes using [file-type](https://npm.im/file-type), not trusting client headers.
- Unknown binary files fall back to `application/octet-stream` instead of the client-provided MIME type.
- Configurable `allowedTypes`, `maxFileSize`, and `maxFiles`.
- Only reads 4KB for MIME detection — streams the rest directly from `Blob`.
- Spec-compatible property names: `filename`, `mimetype`, `encoding`, `createReadStream`.

## Installation

```bash
npm install graphql-upload-nextjs
```

## Migrating from graphql-upload

[graphql-upload](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-upload) uses Express/Koa middleware that is incompatible with Next.js App Router route handlers. This package provides the same `Upload` scalar and file object interface for the Next.js environment.

Property names match the original: `filename`, `mimetype`, `encoding`, `createReadStream`. An additional `fileSize` property is also available.

**Before (graphql-upload with Express):**
```typescript
import graphqlUploadExpress from 'graphql-upload/graphqlUploadExpress.mjs'
app.use(graphqlUploadExpress())
```

**After (graphql-upload-nextjs with App Router):**
```typescript
import { GraphQLUpload, uploadProcess } from 'graphql-upload-nextjs'

// In your route handler:
if (request.headers.get("content-type")?.includes("multipart/form-data")) {
    return await uploadProcess(request, context, server);
}
```

Resolver code stays the same — `filename`, `mimetype`, `encoding`, and `createReadStream` work identically.

## Usage

### Schema and Resolvers

```typescript
import path from 'node:path'
import { createWriteStream } from 'node:fs'
import { pipeline } from 'node:stream'
import { gql } from '@apollo/client' // Optional: syntax highlighting only.
import { ApolloServer } from '@apollo/server'
import { startServerAndCreateNextHandler } from '@as-integrations/next'
import { type File, GraphQLUpload, uploadProcess } from 'graphql-upload-nextjs'
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server.js'

const typeDefs = gql`
    scalar Upload
    type File {
        encoding: String!
        filename: String!
        fileSize: Int!
        mimetype: String!
        uri: String!
    }
    type Query {
        default: Boolean!
    }
    type Mutation {
        uploadFile(file: Upload!): File!
        uploadFiles(files: [Upload!]!): [File!]!
    }
`

interface FileResponse {
    encoding: string;
    filename: string;
    fileSize: number;
    mimetype: string;
    uri: string;
}

const resolvers = {
    Mutation: {
        uploadFile: async (
            _parent: undefined,
            { file }: { file: Promise<File> },
        ): Promise<FileResponse> => {
            const { createReadStream, encoding, filename, fileSize, mimetype } = await file;
            const safeName = path.basename(filename);
            return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                pipeline(
                    createReadStream(),
                    createWriteStream(`./uploads/${safeName}`),
                    (error) => {
                        if (error) reject(new Error("Error during file upload."));
                        else resolve({ encoding, filename: safeName, fileSize, mimetype, uri: `/${safeName}` });
                    },
                );
            });
        },
        uploadFiles: async (
            _parent: undefined,
            { files }: { files: Promise<File>[] },
        ): Promise<FileResponse[]> => {
            const resolvedFiles = await Promise.all(files);
            return Promise.all(resolvedFiles.map(async ({ createReadStream, encoding, filename, fileSize, mimetype }) => {
                const safeName = path.basename(filename);
                return new Promise<FileResponse>((resolve, reject) => {
                    pipeline(
                        createReadStream(),
                        createWriteStream(`./uploads/${safeName}`),
                        (error) => {
                            if (error) reject(new Error(`Error during upload of ${safeName}.`));
                            else resolve({ encoding, filename: safeName, fileSize, mimetype, uri: `/${safeName}` });
                        },
                    );
                });
            }));
        },
    },
    Query: { default: async () => true },
    Upload: GraphQLUpload,
}
```

> **Security:** Always sanitize filenames with `path.basename()` to prevent path traversal attacks. Never write uploaded files to publicly accessible directories in production.

### Route Handler

```typescript
const server = new ApolloServer({ resolvers, typeDefs });

const handler = startServerAndCreateNextHandler<NextRequest>(server, {
    context: async (req: NextRequest) => ({
        ip: req.headers.get("x-forwarded-for") || "",
        req,
    }),
});

const requestHandler = async (request: NextRequest) => {
    if (request.headers.get("content-type")?.includes("multipart/form-data")) {
        const context = { ip: request.headers.get("x-forwarded-for") || "", req: request };
        return await uploadProcess(request, context, server);
    }
    return handler(request);
};

export const GET = requestHandler;
export const POST = requestHandler;
export const OPTIONS = requestHandler;
```

### Configuration

```typescript
await uploadProcess(request, context, server, {
    allowedTypes: ["image/jpeg", "image/png", "text/plain"],
    maxFileSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024, // 10MB
    maxFiles: 10,
});
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `allowedTypes` | `string[]` | `undefined` | Restrict MIME types. Checked against the detected MIME type; unknown binary files are `application/octet-stream`. |
| `maxFileSize` | `number` | `undefined` | Max file size in bytes. Must be finite and non-negative. Returns 413 if exceeded. |
| `maxFiles` | `number` | `undefined` | Max files per request. Must be finite and non-negative. Returns 413 if exceeded. |

### Client Usage

When using a GraphQL client library ([apollo-upload-client](https://npm.im/apollo-upload-client), [urql](https://npm.im/@urql/exchange-multipart-fetch), [extract-files](https://npm.im/extract-files)), file uploads are constructed automatically per the spec.

```typescript
import { gql, useMutation } from '@apollo/client';

const UPLOAD = gql`
  mutation UploadFile($file: Upload!) {
    uploadFile(file: $file) { filename mimetype fileSize }
  }
`;

function Uploader() {
  const [upload] = useMutation(UPLOAD);
  return <input type="file" onChange={(e) => {
    const file = e.target.files?.[0];
    if (file) upload({ variables: { file } });
  }} />;
}
```

## Spec Compliance

Implements the [GraphQL multipart request specification](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec) by [jaydenseric](https://github.com/jaydenseric).

The spec defines a [multipart form field structure](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec#multipart-form-field-structure) with three ordered fields (`operations`, `map`, file fields) and enables nesting files anywhere within operations, operation batching, file deduplication, and file upload streams in resolvers.

### Supported Capabilities

| Spec Capability | Status | Details |
|---|---|---|
| `operations` field ([JSON-encoded GraphQL operation](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec#multipart-form-field-structure)) | Supported | Parsed and validated as object or array. |
| `map` field ([file-to-path mapping](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec#multipart-form-field-structure)) | Supported | Validated: each entry must be an array of string paths. |
| [Single file upload](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec#single-file) | Supported | File mapped via `"variables.file"` path. |
| [File list upload](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec#file-list) | Supported | Files mapped via `"variables.files.0"`, `"variables.files.1"`, etc. |
| [Batching](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec#batching) | Supported | Operations as array, paths prefixed with operation index (`"0.variables.file"`). |
| File deduplication | Supported | One file field mapped to multiple operation paths. |
| [`object-path`](https://npm.im/object-path) dot-notation | Supported | Handles nested objects and array indices. |
| File upload streams in resolvers | Supported | `createReadStream()` returns a Node.js readable stream. |
| Missing file → rejected promise | Supported | Upload promise rejected with `"File missing in the request."` |
| `maxFiles` / `maxFileSize` limits | Supported | Returns HTTP 413 when exceeded. |

### Additions Beyond the Spec

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| MIME magic byte verification | Real file type detected via [file-type](https://npm.im/file-type), not trusting client-provided `Content-Type`. |
| `allowedTypes` filtering | Server-side restriction of accepted MIME types. |
| Unknown binary fallback | Files with no recognized magic bytes and non-text contents are reported as `application/octet-stream`. |
| `fileSize` property | File size in bytes available on the resolved file object. |

### Limitations

These are inherent trade-offs of using the Web `FormData` API for Next.js App Router compatibility. They do not affect normal spec usage.

| Limitation | Reason |
|---|---|
| **No field ordering validation** | The [spec requires](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec#multipart-form-field-structure) `operations` → `map` → files ordering. The Web `FormData` API retrieves fields by name (`formData.get('operations')`), not by position, so ordering cannot be validated. In practice, all major client libraries ([apollo-upload-client](https://npm.im/apollo-upload-client), [extract-files](https://npm.im/extract-files)) send fields in the correct order. |
| **No `maxFieldSize`** | The original [graphql-upload](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-upload) limits non-file field sizes via `busboy`. Next.js parses the full request body into `FormData` before our code runs, so field size limiting is not possible at this layer. |
| **`encoding` is always `'binary'`** | `FormData` does not expose the transfer encoding of file parts. The original `graphql-upload` reads this from `busboy`'s stream events. In practice, transfer encoding is rarely used by resolvers. |
| **No mid-stream abort** | The original uses `fs-capacitor` to buffer uploads to disk, allowing resolvers to abort an in-progress upload. With `FormData`, the entire request body is already parsed by the runtime. However, resolvers can still choose not to call `createReadStream()` to skip processing. |
| **`Blob.stream()` instead of `busboy` streaming** | Next.js route handlers receive a `Request` object (Web API), not a Node.js `IncomingMessage`. There is no access to the raw request stream. `Blob.stream()` provides a replayable readable stream per file. |
